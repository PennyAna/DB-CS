        <p>Forms<br>
            tradit. on form submit, sent to server, info processed w/back end lang like PHP/Ruby
            sed more common now to process form info on front end w/JS before sent to server
        </p>
        <p>
            Form Object
            action attrib URL submitted to for server-side process, also input name attrib used to access info inside
            document.forms returns HTML collection of all forms in doc in order of appearance, 
            so one form: 
            const form = document.forms[0]; = 
            document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0]; = document.forms.search;
            last ex can mix up if form had same name as props or methods of the obj, avoid by using document.forms['search']; (also required if name attrib has invalid chars)
            form obj has method: elements, returns HTML collection of els in form 
            const [input, button] = form.elements;
            et access form controls using name attribs as if prop of form obj, const input = form.searchInput;
            or const input = form['searchInput'];
        </p>
        <p>
            Form Properties and methods<br>
            form.submit() - submitting form using this method won't trigger form submit event
            form.reset() - reset to init vals 
            sed button type:reset or submit work w/o extra scripting
            reset btns considered poor for UX
            form.action prop used to set action attrib of form so sent to diff URL to be processed on server
        </p>
        <p>
            Form Events<br>
            <ul>
                <li>focus</li>
                <li>blur</li>
                <li>change </li>            
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Submitting Form<br>
            use JS to intercept form before sent by adding submit event listener
            preventDefault() actually stops form being submitted to URL
        </p>
        <p>
            Retrieve & Change Values<br>
            text input el obj have val prop, use to retrieve text in field, also can use js to change val 
            placeholder attrib in HTML can also put text in field like ex js (in wk8.js) sed slightly diff behavior b/c text not actual val of input field, won't be submitted as field's val if user leaves blank
        </p>
        <p>Form Control<br>
            <ul>
                <li>input: text, passwords, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads</li>
                <li>
                    select: dropdown list of options
                </li>
                <li>
                    textarea: for longer text entry
                </li>
                <li>
                    button: submit/reset forms (or whatever you tell it to do)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>New Attributes HTML5<br>
            input el has new attribs in HTML5
            autofocus attrib gives focus to an el on pg load
            = document.forms.her.heroName.focus();
            placeholder insert val provided in field until user enters txt, helpful hints on how to fill form
            maxlength attrib limit num chars to be entered in field 
        </p>
        <p>Text Input<br>
            default type input field text
            type=text isn't required but advisable to make purpose explicit, help w/ maintainence, readability, future-proofing
            init val can be set in html w/val attrib 
        </p>
        <p>Password Input<br>
            enter passwords or secret info
            works like text sed characters concealed as entered
        </p>
        <p>Checkbox Input<br>
            true/false options
            can select 1+
            all have same name so accessed as HTML collection 
            ex: form.powers;
            iterate over collection w/for loop for checked = T 
            val prop used to set name if T (add val to empty array)
            more succint ex uses spread operator to turn node list into array, then uses array.filter() to return array w/only T checkboxes, then chain map to end to replace each checkbox w/its val, array returned/stored in hero.powers var: 
            hero.powers = [...form.powers].filter(box => box.checked).map(box => box.value);
            also JS can set checkbox to T/F: document.forms.hero.powers[0].checked = true;
            or use HTMl checked attrib to do same
        </p>
        <p>Radio Input<br>
            type="radio"
            also true/false sed only one option can be selected
            same name attrib used to group together (only one radio w/that name can be checked)
            also HTMl collection of all radio btns in group using name prop: form.category;
            val of radio btn selected stored in form.category.value 
            can also us JS to set val = true/false (form.type[2].checked = true;)
            also checked via checked attrib html
        </p>
        <p>Hidden Input<br>
            type="hidden"
            not displayed by browser sed have val attrib that can contain info submitted w/form 
            often used to send info on settings/info that user already provided 
            sed NOT secret b/c visible in HTMl 
            val can be changed using JS like others
        </p>
        <p>File Input, etc.<br>
            type="file"
            used to upload files, most browsers provide btn to allow selection from user file syst
            new input types in HTML5 like number, tel, color, date, email
            may show up diff in diff browsers
            number fields have opt min/max attribs to limit input given, also step attrib specify skip count w/click 
            most browsers add controls for +/- 
        </p>
        <p>Select Dropdowns<br>
            select 1+ options from list of vals (multiple attrib required if 1+)
            selected attrib used to set init val in html w/blank opt providing instruct msg on load 
            name attrib of select used to access in JS as prop of form obj 
            only 1 selected, return ref to that, or 1+ returns collection w/all selected
            each selection obj has val prop = value attrib of option tag selected: hero.city = form.city.value;
            also can use index of opt using selectedIndex prop: form.city.options[form.city.selectedIndex].text;
            either way, need to account for user picking blank opt in your js  
        </p>
        <p>Text Areas<br>
            used to enter long pieces of text w/multiple lines (comment, blog post)
            work like other input fields 
            access w/name attrib, use val prop for text entered 
            can also change directly (assignment): form.origin.value = "blah blah"
            init val set in html w/text b/t tags
        </p>
        <p>Buttons<br>
            default btn submit
            also plain old btn: does not need to be in a form el, no default behavior, creates clickable btn that can have event listener attached
            also, type menu to combine with menu, menuItem, li tags to create dropdown menu when clicked on (suppt patchy tho)
        </p>
        <p>Form Validation<br>
            checks if info entered correctly: 
            <ul>
                <li>required field</li>
                <li>valid email</li>
                <li>num (not char) entered where required</li>
                <li>password min # chars</li>
            </ul>
            validation both client (using JS) et server sides
            use both to double check since JS can be modified and bypass valid rules, send arbitrary data to database
            js valid used to improve US when filling in form w/feedback before submission
            then more valid on server before saved to database
            sed js valid ensures more valid data sent to serber, cutting down on http requests required to send form back and forth for correction
            HTML5 has own validation API (tho lacking full browser suppt), sed error msgs produced can look inconsistent et difficult to style
            HTML5 API adds relevant attribs to form fields, ex: required
            implement more custom form validation via JS
            use preventDefault() method to stop form submission if !valid 
            improve US more w/instant feedback on form before submission 
            add event listener to input field that will fire when user (event)s 
            feedback inserted inside label el w/error class 
            updated dynamically to reveal added error el
        </p>
        <p>Disable Submit Btn<br>
            to disable submit btn if errors in form, use disabled attrib for input el 
            can be changed w/js changing .disabled = true or false 
        </p>
