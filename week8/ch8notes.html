        <p>Forms<br>
            tradit. on form submit, sent to server, info processed w/back end lang like PHP/Ruby
            sed more common now to process form info on front end w/JS before sent to server
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching Example<br>
            <form name='search' action='/search'>
            <input name="searchInput">
            <button tyoe="submit">Search</button>
            </form>
            <script src="wk8.js"></script>
        </p>
        <p>
            Form Object
            action attrib URL submitted to for server-side process, also input name attrib used to access info inside
            document.forms returns HTML collection of all forms in doc in order of appearance, 
            so one form: 
            const form = document.forms[0]; = 
            document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0]; = document.forms.search;
            last ex can mix up if form had same name as props or methods of the obj, avoid by using document.forms['search']; (also required if name attrib has invalid chars)
            form obj has method: elements, returns HTML collection of els in form 
            const [input, button] = form.elements;
            et access form controls using name attribs as if prop of form obj, const input = form.searchInput;
            or const input = form['searchInput'];
        </p>
        <p>
            Form Properties and methods<br>
            form.submit() - submitting form using this method won't trigger form submit event
            form.reset() - reset to init vals 
            sed button type:reset or submit work w/o extra scripting
            reset btns considered poor for UX
            form.action prop used to set action attrib of form so sent to diff URL to be processed on server
