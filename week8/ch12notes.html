        <p>OOP<br>
             point is encapsulation, user does not know (nor needs to know) how it works in order to use it
             all workings are internal
            polymorphism: same process used for diff obj 
            in OOP, var objs share same method, can override shared with more specific
            inheritance: taking features of obj et adding new features, in OOP, taking existing obj et inherit all props and methods et improve w/new 
        </p>
        <p>
            Java et Ruby (other OOP langs) class-based: use class to define blueprint for obj, objs created as instance of class, inheriting props et methods 
            JS had no class before ES6 ;D 
            used actual objs as blueprint for more: prototype-based lang 
            even w/class suppt now, still using prototypal inheritance model in bckgrnd
        </p>
        <p>
            constructor obj (w/anon funct et this et sub-anons) or obj literal notation for creation
            const newObj = new obj(); (do not need parentheses w/o args)
            sed args can alter obj creation as needed
            JS built-in constructor functs: Object, Array, Function to create instead of literals 
            (even if obj made using literal syntax or Object constructor function, literal still considered instance of Object constructor)
            same/Array sed Array constructor functs show strange behavior w/args supplied so easier to use literals to create Arrays
        </p>
        <p>
            pre ES6, constructor functs used to achieve class-like behavior 
            syntactic sugar: new class declaration syntax does same thing but looks more similar to class-based programming lang:
            class Obj {
                constructor(something=something) {
                    this.something = something;
                }
                lookImaMethod() {
                    return something 
                }
            }
            by convention, name of constructor functs or class declarations capitalized (like convention in class-based langs)
            ES6 declarations preferred b/c succinct, easier to read, all code implicitly in strict mode (don't need to 'use strict') et avoids constructor pitfalls: w/o new operator, class throws error; same w/constructor harder to track(no error)
        </p>
        <p>
            all Objects have constructor prop: returns origin constructor function 
            ex: [Function: Object]
            use this prop to instant copy of obj w/o using actual constructor funct or class declaration (esp if name of origin constructor unknown)
            static keyword creates static method (sometimes class methods in other langs): called by class directly rather than by instances of class
            instances cannot call statics   
        </p>
        <p>
            JS uses prototypal inheritance model 
            every class has prototype prop shared by every instance 
            any props/methods of class' prototype accessed by every obj instant by class 
            const newObj = new Obj(something)
            Obj {name: 'something'}
            when adding methods/props to class post-creation, still do this using prototype prop of class (useful if don't have access to clas declaration)
            Obj.prototype; Obj {}
            Obj.prototype.newProp = 'something'
            OR
            Obj.prototype.newMethod = function() {
                return something;
            }
            sed new Obj instances now inherit these as well
            find out prototype: constructor functs prototype prop: instance.constructor.prototype;
            Obj { method: [Function], prop: something }
            Object.getPrototypeOf(instance);
            many JS engines also suppt non-standard _proto_ prop (dunder proto (double underscore proto))
            instance._proto_, formalized in ES6 b/c already implemented in most browsers/JS libraries sed not official specs, recommend getPrototypeOf() instead, 
            also used to set prototype of obj by assign sed deprecated for setPrototypeOf()
            also isPrototypeOf() returns bool if prototype of an instance: Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(instance) true 
        </p>
        <p>
            obj has prop et access to all, if inherited from class declaration belongs to obj; if inherited from prototype, does not belong to obj but can use
            use hasOwnProperty() method to see which belong to obj or prototype
            prototype props shared w/every instance of class et w/same val et this prop only in mem in one place: in the prototype 
            prototype live so any new props/methods added, all instances inherit statim, even if already created before addition, same w/new vals for props 
            not possible to overwrite prototype by assign new obj literal if class declaration used 
            sed can do it w/constructor functs used sed prob if redefine prototype accidentally (existing instances retain props/methods of old sed not receive any new added to redefined): another reason to use class decs
            instance can overwrite any prop/methods inherited by assign new val then they are 'property' of instance not prototype
            owned props precedent over prototype prop in methods (JS engine follows chain until finds prop/method)
        </p>
        <p>
            Use of prototype: 
            add new props/methods post class dec
            define props remaining same for every instance 
            methods usually same for all instances so usually fine to add to prototype 
            careful, default vals set by prototype are shallow, any changes to array or obj made by instance seen in prototype and shared to all others
            ita: never use arrays/objs as default val in prototype
            mixin can be used to add multiple props at same time
        </p>
        <p>
            public vs private methods: 
            default: methods public in JS
            so can be queried directly/changed by assign (dynamic lang and all)
            if objs public-facing-avoid-too much access by users
            sed var scope keeps some props/methods private in class dec, preventing access/change(ergo: use getters/setters)
            private props now managed in controlled way/screening any data made by user/external 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prototype chain: 
            prototype of prototype empty obj literal (actually instance of built-in Object() constructor funct)
            beyond that: null 
            instance-->instanceObject-->objectPrototype-->prototype-->Object constructor function
        </p>
        <p>
            prototype of Obj constructor funct has methods inherited by all objs sed prototype appears empty b/c all methods not enumerable (will not show up when a for-in loop used thru objs props/methods)
            propertyIsEnumerable() to check (all props/methods created by assign enumerable)
            ex: toString() not enum 
            make all methods non enum (yours are safe) and any user defined methods enum (easy to find)
        </p>
        <p>
            inheritance w/extends in class dec to inherit from another class 
            in child class dec keyword super refers to parent class and used to access any props/methods of parent
            polymorphism allows diff objs to have same method et implement diff
            ex: toString()
        </p>
        <p>
            can add more methods to built-ins (Number, String, Array) = monkeypatching (frowned on in JS) (Ruby likes it)
            Arrays lack first(), last(), delete() (js delete leaves null in place of removed)
            useful monkeypatching: add suppt for specs methods not natively supptd in browsers (like most IEs)
            monkeypatching can lead to bad behavior, at least avoid w/built-in obj constructor prototypes 
            if you do: check for built-ins first then mimic that functionality
            use extends to subclass built class/create own
        </p>
        <p>
            each prop has attribs providing info de prop
            stored in prop descriptor=obj containing vals of each attrib
            have: 
            value: undefined by default
            writable: bool, false by default
            enumerable: bool, false by default
            configurable: bool, can delete/change, false by default 
            possible to set prop attribs by using prop descriptor 
            cannot set attribs added props of obj (set to true when obj made)
            Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
            Object.defineProperty() used to add prop to obj w/o assign 
            more control when adding new props b/c attrib can be set-first arg is obj to add the property to, next prop descriptor w/attribs to set, any left out default 
            obj property descriptor can have get()/set() methods instead of val attrib
            all objs one or other never both 
            can be used to control how prop is set using assign and val returned when prop queried, useful if prop relies on val of other prop 
            can also change what get() method returns despite val set by assign 
            use sparingly
        </p>
        <p>
            can avoid classes just creating new obj based on other obj as blueprint 
            create method from Object constructor funct used to Object.create() new exact copy of obj as arg
            can add props as second arg 
            origin obj is live b/c prototype 
            also superclass 
            add init method to init props 
            SuperObject.init = function(something, alsoSomething) {
                this.something = something;
                this.alsoSomething = alsoSomething;
                this.init = undefined; (removes init function for only one call)
                return this;
            }
            can chain: const instance = Object.create(SuperObject).init(something, something);
            objects from objects creates a prototype chain
            sed instanceOf will not work here 
        </p>
        <p>Mixins<br>
            add props/methods of one obj to another w/o using inheritance 
            mix basic obj together for more complex
            basic functionality: Object.assign() method: assign to the obj (first arg) all props from objs as rest of args
            sed no arrays or nested obj since only shallow copy
            sed to avoid: create own mixin() funct to assign all props of obj to another obj w/deep copy
            every obj inherit this method and can use to augment from other objs
            function mixin(target,...objects) {
                for (const object of objects) {   
                if(typeof object === 'object') {
                    for (const key of Object.keys(object)) {
                        if (typeof object[key] === 'object') {
                        target[key] = Array.isArray(object[key]) ? [] : {};
                        mixin(target[key],object[key]);
                        } else {
                        Object.assign(target,object);  
                        }
                    }
                    }
                }
                return target;
            }
            can add many props to obj at one time
            can use to create copy() function (exact,deep)
            function copy(target) {
                const object =  Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(target));
                mixin(object,target);
                return object;
            }
            not copied by ref so changes will not affect each other 
            add modular funct (no chain of inheritance), encapsulate props/methods in obj then add to others w/o chain 
            diff is whether object IS something or HAS something 
            each mixin returns val of this 
            b/c 'this', these methods can be chained for sequence of method calls 
            common technique w/JS libraries like jQuery/Jest
            sed makes code difficult to debug
            if method doesn't have anything important to return, might as well return this so can chain
            can bind this within scope, important b/c this usually ref's global window obj = undefined 
            use that = this within funct and use in nested funct instead of this (or self or _this)
            bind() can set val of this w/in funct while in scope 
            for-of instead forEach(): does not require nested funct so this remains bound to non-global obj (ES6)
            Arrow functs (ES6) don't have own this context so remain bound to orig obj making funct call 
            use them when anon functs required in callbacks 
        </p>
        <p>
            can borrow singleton methods w/o having to take all
            make ref to funct borrowing (w/o parentheses)
            const something = object.somethingElse;
            common in ES5 to borrow methods from arrays like slice(), Es6: Array.from() used to turn array-like obj into array 
            et spread operator does same
