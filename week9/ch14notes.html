            HTML5
            HTML5.1, W3C recommended Nov 2016
            HTML equiv of ES6 for JS, 5.2 in dev 
            sep'd into modules allowing diff features to be dev'd at different paces/implementations w/o waiting for others' completion
            Check site: Can I Use for working elements
            names of attributes individual sed use format: 
                start with data- 
                contain only lc letters, nums, hyphens, dots, colons, underscores
                include opt str val
            info in attribs used to id elements ex: all elements w/attrib data-dropdown id'd as dropdown menu 
            also use attrib val to filter ex: find all elements w/ data-rating val of 3+
            each element has dataset prop to access data- attrib it contains
            ex: const valname = document.getElementById('elname'); const valname2 = valname.dataset.valname2; 
            data- prefix dropped here, attrib used as if prop of dataset obj 
            if data- attrib name contains hyphens, replaced w/camel-case
            most browsers suppt data-, in older, any data- attrib can be grabbed w/getAttribute()
            above ex can be const valname2= valname.getAttribute('data-valname2');
            restrict for only str val overcome w/encoding any JS obj/val as JSON str then type convert later
            ex const maxLength = Number(element.dataset.maxLength);
            data attribs == convenient way to add data directly to HTML markup == better UX
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 APIs
                APIs to gain access to hardware like cameras, batteries, geolocation, graphics
                new APIs always needed to keep apace w/latest hardware et devices
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 Web Storage
                provides key-val store on client com simil to cookies w/fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, easier to underscores
                use to store info de users et app-specific info to be used during future sess
                crucial diffs w/cookies: 
                    info stored not shared w/server on every request
                    info avail in multiple windows of browser if domain is same
                    storage capacity limit usually around 5GB per domain (no actual specified limit sed general browser limit)
                    data stored does not auto expire
                if browser suppts, window obj has prop localStorage, native obj w/props/meths to store data 
                info saved in key-val pairs, vals only str 
                also sessionStorage obj working the same way tho data only saved for current sess
                ex: localStorage.setItem('name', 'Some Name');
                if above, close browser, reopen and localStorage.getItem('name'); get the val you put there. 
                Don't need to use getter and setter, assignment like var also used localStorage.name = 'aName';
                to remove: localStorage.removeItem('name');
                or delete localStorage.name;
                complete wipe, use clear(): localStorage.clear();
                when val saved to localStorage, storage event fired on any other windows/tabs from same domain et only if the val of the item being saved changed. event obj sent by event listener to callback has props w/info de updated item: 
                    key tells key of item changed
                    newValue tells new val changed to
                    oldValue tells prev val
                    storageArea tells if stored in local or sess storage
                below logs info de Web Storage changes (will not work locally)
                addEventListener('storage', (event) => { console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from ${$event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in ${event.storageArea}`)}, false);
                using JSON, can store any JS obj in local storage:
                localStorage.setItem('valName', JSON.stringify(objName); saves obj as JSON str using val as key 
                to retrieve: valName = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('valName'));
            </p>
            <p>
                Geolocation 
                obtain geographical position of device: 
                    find user exact location, link to nearby places, measure user speed.
                can be used to filter data based on user's location/speed/direction of travel ex: search function return results based on location (obvs privacy concerns/laws granted by user first)
                if avail, prop of navigator obj 
                prop has method getCurrentPosition() that returns position obj to specific callback function called youAreHere() ex: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
                posit obj passed to youArehere() has coords prop w/latitude/longitude prop for coords
                can use these w/other apps or web services (like mapping)
                position obj props used to find out info de location/movement of device:
                    position.speed returns ground speed of device, meters per second
                    position.altitude returns estimate of device's altitude in meters above WGS84 ellipsoid, standard measure for center/earth 
                    position.heading returns direction device is moving in, measured in bearing in degrees clockwise from north
                    position.timestamp returns time position info was recorded 
                    other props calculate accuracy of measurements, sometimes do not need specificity but general position
                        position.accuracy returns accuracy of lat and log props in meters, lower returned val = more accurate measurements, also position.altitudeAccuracy prop returning accuracy of altitude prop in meters
                geolocation also has watchPosition(), calls callback funct when position of device updated, returns id to ref posit being watched 
                const id = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(youAreHere);
                clearWatch() used to stop callback being called, using id of the watch as arg
                geolocation API interface to add location-based info to site/app 
            </p>
            <p>
                API privacy concerns 
                especially newer APIs, consider security and privacy if using 
                ambient light API could make data theft possible
                battery API dropped by Apple et Mozilla w/concerns over user profiling
            </p>
            <p>
                Web Workers
                allow process to run in bkgrnd, adding suppt for concurrency in single-threaded JS 
                processes taking a long time carried out in bkgrnd so site can function w/o script has become unresponsive msg
                worker() constructor function to create new worker, ex: const worker = new Worker('task.js');
                (Chrome won't let you run workers from local files, workaround: start Chrome using --allow-file-access-from-files flag or use diff browser, only use flag for dev not reg browse) 
                Worker() takes name of js file as arg, if file, it's downloaded async, worker only starts once file completely downloaded. if !file, throw error 
                var assigned to constructor refer to worker in main program, in worker script keyword self used
                use msgs to communicate b/t main and worker script: 
                    postMessage() used to send msg and start worker working, arg can send any data to web worker. 
                    ex: worker.PostMessage('msg'); (this is from main.js)
                    self.postMessage('msg'); (this is form worker script)
                    when msg posted, message event fired so dealt w/using eventlistener, data sent as arg store din data prop of event obj passed to callback function
                    ex: worker.addEventListener('msg', (event) => {console.log(event.data);}, false);
                    when worker complette stopped using terminate() method from main script: worker.terminate() 
                    or close() form worker script: self.close()
            </p>

            <p>
                Shared Web Workers & Service Workers
                above are dedicated web workers linked to script that loaded the worker, unable to be used by another 
                can create shared web workers that allow access to same worker obj by diff scripts on same domain 
                workers especially useful to perform complex operations ( like math)
                Service Worker API allows worker script to run in bkgrnd w/ability to intercept network requests
                so take alternative action if network offline, effective app-like ofline experiences
                also allow access to push notifications/bkgrnd syncing
                require secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid code hijacking/malicious code network requests
            </p>
            <p>
                Websockets
                downfall of HTTP protocol is only get response when request sent 
                if response comes later, you'd have to send another request to get it
                partially solved w/Ajax et method-polling-where request periodically sent to see if response ready
                Websocket-new protocol allowing 2way comm w/server (also push messaging), connection kept open et responses pushed to client as received
            </p>
            <p>
                Notifications
                allows showing messages using syst notifications, usually popup sed depends on os, advantage: still be displayed even if page calling isn't current tab
                Obvs need permission form user: requestPermission() method of Notification global obj 
                ex: if(window.Notification) {
                    Notification.requestPermission();
                }
                returns promise w/obj set to 'granted' or 'denied'. if yes, create new notification using constructor funct 
                ex: if(window.Notification) {
                    Notification.requestPermission()
                    .then((permission) => {
                        if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {
                            new Notification('notificationTitle'); 
                        }
                    });
                }
                constructor also accepts 2nd param: obj of options including body (text to appear below title), icon (can specify link to image to be displayed in notification)
                ex: const notification= new Notification('titleName', {
                    body: 'optionalMsg', 
                    icon: 'image.png'
                });
                depends on browser et os, som notifications auto close post short time period, some stay til user clicks. close from code w/ close()
                events can react to: click, show, close, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multimedia
                HTML5 intro'd <audio> et <video> tags to insert clips into page. also intro'd Media API for controlling playback of clips using JS
                <audio src='/song.mp3'controls>Your browser does not support the video element</audio>
                <video src='url' controls>Your browser does not support the video element</video>
                any content inside tags only display if browser does not suppt them.
                controls attrib added w/o val, will display browser's native controls (play, pause, volume)
                audio/video element ref'd by var using DOM method 
                ex: const video = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0];
                play() starts from current posit 
                pause() pause at current posit
                volume prop num used to set audio volume 
                muted prop bool to mute audio 
                currentTime prop num val used to jmp to another part of clip +- seconds 
                playbackRate prop fastfwd or rewind clip by changing playback val. val=1 normal speed, +8 would be 8x as fast as normal 
                loop prop bool set to true for clip loop
                duration prop used to see length of clip 
                some of props only avail once browser receives all metadata assoc'd w/vid 
                to ensure val returned, use event listener to fire once metadata loaded
                ex: video.addEventListener('loadmetadata', () => {console.log(video.duration); });
                audio/video events: 
                    play-fires when clip starts et resumes post pause
                    pause- fires when clip paused
                    volumechange fires when vol changed
                    loadedmetadata fires when all vid metadata loaded 
                events let you respond to user interact w/video
                audio/video alements bring native suppt for multimedia into browser, API gives devs control of playb ack audio/video
                Is this why we're officially phasing out flash??

                Drawing w/Canvas
                canvas el intro'd to draw graphics real time on web page using JS 
                canvas el rect el on pg w/coordinate syst starting at (0,0) in top-left corner 
                add canvas el to pg: <canvas> used specifying height and width, anything placed inside tag only displays if canvas not supported
                ex: <canvas id='canvas'width='400'height='400'>Your browser does not support the canvas element</canvas>
                access in JS program using const canvasElement = document.getElementById('canvas');
                context is object containing all methods used to draw on canvas (2D or 3D (with WebGL))
                const context = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
                fill/stroke colors changed by assigning css color to fillstyle and strokestyle props 
                lineWidth prop used to set width of line strokes, detault 1px but can change 
                fillRext() draw filled-in rectangle, first two params coordinates of top-left corner, 3rd param width, last param height. 
                strokeRect() works same way w/rectangle not filled in 
                straight lines draw employing moveTo() and lineTo(), used together to produce path
                nothing drawn until stroke() called
                arc() used to draw arc of given radius from given point, first two params coordinates of center of arc, next param radius, next param start angle, next param finish angle (both angles measured in radians), last param bool for whether to draw counter-clockwise 
                hint ( Math.PI * 2 == full turn)
                fillText() used to write text onto canvas, first param text to be displayed, next two params x,y coords 
                font prop sets font style used else inherited from canvas element's css setting (if changing, do so before calling fillText())
                Advantage: drawing data charts updated in real-time et animate HTML5 games
            </p>
            <p>
                Shims & Polyfills
                phrases sometimes used interchangeably
                since devs can't control how up-to-date user browsers are, need shims/polyfills: libraries of code allowing API use as usual, filling in necesse code not natively in user browser 
                shim: piece of code adding missing fucntionality to browser sed implement method differ slightly from standard API
                polyfill: shim that does the same thing using API commands that would be used if feature supptd natively 
                Advantage: use APIs in code and get expected results despite browsers, use usual set of standard API commands w/o having to write addt'l code for diff levels of suppt, when users update browsers, seamless experience, no change.
                once enough users have updated browsers, can remove polyfill w/o having to update any js code.
