            HTML5
            HTML5.1, W3C recommended Nov 2016
            HTML equiv of ES6 for JS, 5.2 in dev 
            sep'd into modules allowing diff features to be dev'd at different paces/implementations w/o waiting for others' completion
            Check site: Can I Use for working elements
            names of attributes individual sed use format: 
                start with data- 
                contain only lc letters, nums, hyphens, dots, colons, underscores
                include opt str val
            info in attribs used to id elements ex: all elements w/attrib data-dropdown id'd as dropdown menu 
            also use attrib val to filter ex: find all elements w/ data-rating val of 3+
            each element has dataset prop to access data- attrib it contains
            ex: const valname = document.getElementById('elname'); const valname2 = valname.dataset.valname2; 
            data- prefix dropped here, attrib used as if prop of dataset obj 
            if data- attrib name contains hyphens, replaced w/camel-case
            most browsers suppt data-, in older, any data- attrib can be grabbed w/getAttribute()
            above ex can be const valname2= valname.getAttribute('data-valname2');
            restrict for only str val overcome w/encoding any JS obj/val as JSON str then type convert later
            ex const maxLength = Number(element.dataset.maxLength);
            data attribs == convenient way to add data directly to HTML markup == better UX

                HTML5 APIs
                APIs to gain access to hardware like cameras, batteries, geolocation, graphics
                new APIs always needed to keep apace w/latest hardware et devices
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 Web Storage
                provides key-val store on client com simil to cookies w/fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, easier to underscores
                use to store info de users et app-specific info to be used during future sess
                crucial diffs w/cookies: 
                    info stored not shared w/server on every request
                    info avail in multiple windows of browser if domain is same
                    storage capacity limit usually around 5GB per domain (no actual specified limit sed general browser limit)
                    data stored does not auto expire
                if browser suppts, window obj has prop localStorage, native obj w/props/meths to store data 
                info saved in key-val pairs, vals only str 
                also sessionStorage obj working the same way tho data only saved for current sess
                ex: localStorage.setItem('name', 'Some Name');
                if above, close browser, reopen and localStorage.getItem('name'); get the val you put there. 
                Don't need to use getter and setter, assignment like var also used localStorage.name = 'aName';
                to remove: localStorage.removeItem('name');
                or delete localStorage.name;
                complete wipe, use clear(): localStorage.clear();
                when val saved to localStorage, storage event fired on any other windows/tabs from same domain et only if the val of the item being saved changed. event obj sent by event listener to callback has props w/info de updated item: 
                    key tells key of item changed
                    newValue tells new val changed to
                    oldValue tells prev val
                    storageArea tells if stored in local or sess storage
                below logs info de Web Storage changes (will not work locally)
                addEventListener('storage', (event) => { console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from ${$event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in ${event.storageArea}`)}, false);
                using JSON, can store any JS obj in local storage:
                localStorage.setItem('valName', JSON.stringify(objName); saves obj as JSON str using val as key 
                to retrieve: valName = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('valName'));
            </p>
            <p>
                Geolocation 
                obtain geographical position of device: 
                    find user exact location, link to nearby places, measure user speed.
                can be used to filter data based on user's location/speed/direction of travel ex: search function return results based on location (obvs privacy concerns/laws granted by user first)
                if avail, prop of navigator obj 
                prop has method getCurrentPosition() that returns position obj to specific callback function called youAreHere() ex: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
                posit obj passed to youArehere() has coords prop w/latitude/longitude prop for coords
                can use these w/other apps or web services (like mapping)
                position obj props used to find out info de location/movement of device:
                    position.speed returns ground speed of device, meters per second
                    position.altitude returns estimate of device's altitude in meters above WGS84 ellipsoid, standard measure for center/earth 
                    position.heading returns direction device is moving in, measured in bearing in degrees clockwise from north
                    position.timestamp returns time position info was recorded 
                    other props calculate accuracy of measurements, sometimes do not need specificity but general position
                        position.accuracy returns accuracy of lat and log props in meters, lower returned val = more accurate measurements, also position.altitudeAccuracy prop returning accuracy of altitude prop in meters
                geolocation also has watchPosition(), calls callback funct when position of device updated, returns id to ref posit being watched 
                const id = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(youAreHere);
                clearWatch() used to stop callback being called, using id of the watch as arg
                geolocation API interface to add location-based info to site/app

                Web Workers
                allow process to run in bkgrnd, adding suppt for concurrency in single-threaded JS 
                processes taking a long time carried out in bkgrnd so site can function w/o script has become unresponsive msg
                worker() constructor function to create new worker, ex: const worker = new Worker('task.js');
                (Chrome won't let you run workers from local files, workaround: start Chrome using --allow-file-access-from-files flag or use diff browser, only use flag for dev not reg browse) 
                Worker() takes name of js file as arg, if file, it's downloaded async, worker only starts once file completely downloaded. if !file, throw error 
                var assigned to constructor refer to worker in main program, in worker script keyword self used
                use msgs to communicate b/t main and worker script: 
                    postMessage() used to send msg and start worker working, arg can send any data to web worker. 
                    ex: worker.PostMessage('msg'); (this is from main.js)
                    self.postMessage('msg'); (this is form worker script)
                    when msg posted, message event fired so dealt w/using eventlistener, data sent as arg store din data prop of event obj passed to callback function
                    ex: worker.addEventListener('msg', (event) => {console.log(event.data);}, false);
                    when worker complette stopped using terminate() method from main script: worker.terminate() 
                    or close() form worker script: self.close()
            </p>

                Shared Web Workers & Service Workers
                above are dedicated web workers linked to script that loaded the worker, unable to be used by another 
                can create shared web workers that allow access to same worker obj by diff scripts on same domain 
                workers especially useful to perform complex operations ( like math)
                Service Worker API allows worker script to run in bkgrnd w/ability to intercept network requests
                so take alternative action if network offline, effective app-like ofline experiences
                also allow access to push notifications/bkgrnd syncing
                require secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid code hijacking/malicious code network requests
