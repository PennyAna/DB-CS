        Notes
        <p>
        BOM (Browser Object Model)
        collection of properties et methods with info de browser/computer screen
        ex: find dimensions of screen view, history
        no official standard, sed mostly supptd by all major browsers
        avail thru window obj, each browser window, tab, popup, frame, iframe have one. 
        Node.js != window obj, sed still global obj (const global = this; to assign)
        </p>
        <p>
        Globals
        globals created w/o using const, let, var - window.globalName 
        sed refer w/o using window for more portable b/t enviros
        parseInt() and isNaN() methods of global obj (ES6 made these methods of Number obj as well)
        </p>
        <p>
        Dialogs
        alert(), confirm(), prompt() not part of ES standard sed major browser suppt
        all stop execution of program to tell/do/get something, return undefined/bool/str(or null)
        Mostly not to be used sed confirm could be final check before delete item/resource  
        etiam browsers allow users to disable dialogs so cannot rely on their use
        </p>
        <p>
        Browser info
        window.navigator.userAgent returns info on browser and os being used
        sed can be modded to masque as a diff browser, etiam, all browsers still include mozilla in userAgent b/c legacy Netscape compat
        et userAgent deprecated from official
        window.location obj with info de url of current pg, has props w/info de fragments of url
        window.location.href returns full str url, read/write prop so can be changed by assign
        window.location.protocol describes protocol used (http:, https:, pop2:, ftp: etc.) as str
        window.location.host returns str w/domain of current url and port num (omitted if default port 80 used)
        window.location.hostname returns str with only domain of current URL
        window.location.port returns str with port num sed empty string if port not explicit stated in URL
        window.location.pathname returns str of path post domain 
        window.location.search returns str with ? + query str params. if none, returns empty str.
        window.location.hash returns str w/ # + fragment id. empty str if none
        window.location.origin returns str w/protocol et domain where current pg origin from (read-only)
        window.location obj methods:
        reload() forces reload of current pg, if given true param, force browser server reload non cached pg
        assign() used to load alter resource from url as param 
        replace() almost same as assign() sed current pg not stored in sess hist, unable to nav back using back btn 
        toString() returns str with whole url 
        </p>
        <p>
        Browser History:
        window.history access info de prev visited pgs in current browser sess 
        history != new HTML5 History API
        window.history.length prop shows num pgs visited pre current pg
        window.history.go() go to specific pg, 0 is current pg (1: go fwd 1 pg, 0: reload current, -1: bwd 1 pg)
        also window.history.forward() et window.history.back() acts like browser fwd/bwd btns 
        </p>
        <p>
        Controlling Windows:
        window.open(), new window taking url of pg to be opened as 1st param, window title as 2nd param, list of attr as 3rd param, can also be assigned to a var so can be ref'd later
        ex: const popup = window.open('url', 'title', 'width=100, height=100, resizable=yes');
        pop.close() to close window if have ref
        window.moveTo() move window to x/y coord of screen, ita two params (x, y)
        window.resizeTo() resize window, two params for width/height 
        sed popups annoying et bad usability to resize/move user's window et browsers disallow some methods (can't resize w/1+ tabs, can't move/resize window not created by window.open())
        </p>
        <p>
        Screen Information:
        window.screen obj info de screen browser displayed on
        use window.screen.height, window.screen.width for px dimension 
        window.screen.availWidth, window.screen.availHeight used to find h/w - os menus
        window.screen.colorDepth finds color bit depth of user's monitor sed not useful sed for user statistic collect 
        screen obj more useful for mobile, lets turn off device screen, detect orient change et lock orient
        most of prev meths et props have been superseded by better practices (media queries, feature detection, etc.)
        </p>
        <p>
        Document Object: 
        window obj has document obj w/props et meths to deal w/pg loaded into window 
        document.write() writes str to pg, if pg loaded, str replaces current doc completely
        can include HTML in str to be part of DOM tree
        et used w/in doc in script tags to inject str into markup w/o overwriting rest of html
        sed document.write() frowned on b/c only used by mixing js w/in html 
        </p>
        <p>
        Cookies:
        small files saved local on user comp
        invented by Netscape to get around HTTP being stateless protocol ("I have no memory of this place") from one request/visit to another
        store info to be retrieved b/t requests
        restriction: can only be read by web pg from same domain that set them, stops site accessing info de users like other sites visited 
        et limited up to 4KB data, 20 cookies allowed per domain 
        personalize user browse exp, store user pref, track user choice (shopping cart), authentication et tracking users 
        cookie use for data storage being replaced by new HTML5 localStorage API since allows more data storage 
        still useful for retaining state info b/c passed b/t client/server eveyr http request 
        take form of text file w/ list of name/val pairs
        ex: "name=Superman; hero=true; city=Metropolis"
        EU Cookie Directive requires sites based in EU country to ask permission pre cookie setting. 
        create cookie: assign to js 'cookie jar' using document.cookie prop ex document.cookie = 'name=Superman';
        assigning new cookie won't overwrite entire property, sed append to end of string. 
        change cookie: reassign to document.cookie w/same name sed diff val, updates that name/val pair 
        read cookie: to see current contents of cookie jar, document.cookie
        use split to create array for each name/val pair, then for of loop to iterate
        ex: const cookies = document.cookie.split("; ");
        for (crumb of cookies) {
            const [key, value] = crumb.split("=");
            console.log(`The value of ${key} is ${value}`);
        }
        cookie expire dates-session cookies by default, deleted when browser sess finished (when user closes tab or window)
        can be made persistent w/ "; expires=date" to end of cookie when set (date = date val in UTC str format (Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT))
        ex: const expiryDate = new Date();
        const tomorrow = expiryDate.getTime() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
        expirydate.setTime(tomorrow);
        document.cookie = `name=Batman; expires=${ expiryDate.toUTCString()}`;
        et alter set max-age val (in seconds) not supptd in IE before v.10 document.cookie = 'name=Batman; max-age=86400' (86400 secs = 1 day)
        apps w/ sensitive info don't rely on cookie expiry w/these methods. browsers can hold info stored in expiring cookie when session restore feature used post crash
        default, cookies read by pgs inside same directory/domain as file was set, security->access limited
        can change path so any pg in root can read cookie, add : path=/ to end of cookie when set
        et set domain w/ "; domain=domainName" to end of cookie (lets all subdomains read)
        add ; secure to end of cookie to ensure only transmit over secure HTTPS network
        to delete, set to expire in past
        JS cookie handling basic/cumbersome, libraries like Cookies.js or jsCookie avail
        </p>
        <p>
        Timing Functions: 
        window.setTimeout() takes callback to function as 1st param et num of ms as 2nd param, returns int: id used to ref that timeout. 
        can cancel timeout using window.clearTimeout(id int)
        window.setInterval() repeat invoke callback funct post every given num of ms
        can use anon or named function window.setInterval(function name, ms time)
        to stop, use window.clearInterval() w/var var repeat as arg 
        window.clearInterval(function name)
        cavete using method w/this with these timing methods, binding of this is set to window obj not method obj so results may vary. Bind this to obj instead
        </p>
        <p>
        Animation:
        can use setTimeout() setInterval() methods can animate elements on pg. 
        rotates using css3 transform prop, this was only way to animate w/JS until window.requestAnimationFrame() method developed
        requestAnimationFrame() works like setInterval() sed improved, make best use of browser builtin graphics-handling, not running animation when inactive tab, ita smoother performance
        supported in all major browsers (IE v.10+)
        frame rate cannot be set using this, usually 60 fps sed optimized for device 
        to start, call requestAnimationFrame(function name), returns id that can be used to stop animation w/window.cancelAnimationFrame(id name)
        SED animations in browser can be made w/pure CSS 
        set animation: spin 4s linear infinite;
        @keyframes spin {from {transform:rotate(0deg);} to {transform:rotate(3600deg);}}
        better to use CSS for animation effects
