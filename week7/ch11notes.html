        <p>Function Properties & Methods<br>
            in JS functiosn first-class obj, can be passed around like other vals
            can have own props et methods, accept other functions as params, be returned by other functions
            all have length prop returning num params 
            call() used to set val of this inside function to an obj provided as first arg , if funct called requires any params, provided as args post 1st arg (always will be this)
            using call() w/o obj ref'd as this, need null as first arg 
            apply() works same way, sed args of funct provided as array, even if only 1 arg, useful if data is already array (not actually needed ES6 w/spread operator to split array of vals into sep params)
            can add own props
        </p>
        <p>Memoization<br>
            results caching (memoization)
            if function takes time to compute return val, save result in cache prop, if same arg used later, return val from cache instead or recomputing
            obj.cache[result]
        </p>
        <p>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions<br>
            IIFE (iffy)
            anon function invoked when defined
            parentheses at end of function definition, also put function declaration inside another parentheses to make it an expression 
            ex: (function(){const temp = 'World';console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);})();
            useful to perform task et keep vars wrapped w/in scope, global namespace not polluted w/unecessary var names 
            can't remove var from scope once declared
            temp vars needed esp. to keep var names avail for other code (like external js library)
            put code into IIFE, only avail while IIFE invoked, then disappears
            IIFE used to set up init code not needed later
            sed can be achieved by placing code inside block so block scope maintained 
            placing 'use strict' at begin/file enforces strict mode on all js in file
            avoid: use strict mode placing all code inside IIFE ex: (function() {
                'use strict';
                all code that needs to be in strict mode
            })();
            IIFE enclose in private scope, ita code +/- separately
            useful to sep parts/program into discrete sections, esp. for testing purposes
            again, ES6 placed diff parts of code into blocks
            et module pattern
            function that calls/defines/redefines self: assign anon funct to var w/same name as function 
            ex: function party() {
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                    console.log('Been there, got the t-shirt');
                }
            }
            first msg logged then party redefined to new msg
            assigned to new var, var maintain original definition, not rewritten b/c original function assigned to var, then w/in function, var w/same name as function assigned to diff function (phew!)
            if props set on function, lost when function redefines self
            ex: function party(){
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                    console.log('Been there, got the t-shirt');
                }
            }
            party.music = 'classical jazz'
            party() output first msg
            party.music output undefined b/c function redefined and prop doesn't exist
            Lazy Definition Pattern, often used when init code required first time invoked, then do something else next invokation 
        </p>
        <p>Init-Time Branching<br>
            use w/redefining functions
            useful to work effectively in browser w/o checking for features every time invoked
            once invoked, rewritten based on browser capabilities so useful to check function 
        </p>
        <p>Recursive Functions<br>
            invokes self til condition met 
            useful for iterative processes
            common use: factorial num calc et Collatz Conjecture: has not been solved: take any positive int, if num even, divide by two, if odd, x3 +1
            ends up looping at end
            every pos int create looping sequence
            use recursion to invoke collatz function until reaches 1 (to avoid recursive looping in function) w/num param w/sequence param ([first param]), second only used when recursive called (count steps)
            Callbacks<br>
            functions passed as args et invoked inside function passed to
        </p>
        <p>Event-Driven Async<br>
