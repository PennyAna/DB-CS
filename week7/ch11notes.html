        <p>Function Properties & Methods<br>
            in JS functiosn first-class obj, can be passed around like other vals
            can have own props et methods, accept other functions as params, be returned by other functions
            all have length prop returning num params 
            call() used to set val of this inside function to an obj provided as first arg , if funct called requires any params, provided as args post 1st arg (always will be this)
            using call() w/o obj ref'd as this, need null as first arg 
            apply() works same way, sed args of funct provided as array, even if only 1 arg, useful if data is already array (not actually needed ES6 w/spread operator to split array of vals into sep params)
            can add own props
        </p>
        <p>Memoization<br>
            results caching (memoization)
            if function takes time to compute return val, save result in cache prop, if same arg used later, return val from cache instead or recomputing
            obj.cache[result]
        </p>
        <p>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions<br>
            IIFE (iffy)
            anon function invoked when defined
            parentheses at end of function definition, also put function declaration inside another parentheses to make it an expression 
            ex: (function(){const temp = 'World';console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);})();
            useful to perform task et keep vars wrapped w/in scope, global namespace not polluted w/unecessary var names 
            can't remove var from scope once declared
            temp vars needed esp. to keep var names avail for other code (like external js library)
            put code into IIFE, only avail while IIFE invoked, then disappears
            IIFE used to set up init code not needed later
            sed can be achieved by placing code inside block so block scope maintained 
            placing 'use strict' at begin/file enforces strict mode on all js in file
            avoid: use strict mode placing all code inside IIFE ex: (function() {
                'use strict';
                all code that needs to be in strict mode
            })();
            IIFE enclose in private scope, ita code +/- separately
            useful to sep parts/program into discrete sections, esp. for testing purposes
            again, ES6 placed diff parts of code into blocks
            et module pattern
            function that calls/defines/redefines self: assign anon funct to var w/same name as function 
            ex: function party() {
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                    console.log('Been there, got the t-shirt');
                }
            }
            first msg logged then party redefined to new msg
            assigned to new var, var maintain original definition, not rewritten b/c original function assigned to var, then w/in function, var w/same name as function assigned to diff function (phew!)
            if props set on function, lost when function redefines self
            ex: function party(){
                console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
                party = function(){
                    console.log('Been there, got the t-shirt');
                }
            }
            party.music = 'classical jazz'
            party() output first msg
            party.music output undefined b/c function redefined and prop doesn't exist
            Lazy Definition Pattern, often used when init code required first time invoked, then do something else next invokation 
        </p>
        <p>Init-Time Branching<br>
            use w/redefining functions
            useful to work effectively in browser w/o checking for features every time invoked
            once invoked, rewritten based on browser capabilities so useful to check function 
        </p>
        <p>Recursive Functions<br>
            invokes self til condition met 
            useful for iterative processes
            common use: factorial num calc et Collatz Conjecture: has not been solved: take any positive int, if num even, divide by two, if odd, x3 +1
            ends up looping at end
            every pos int create looping sequence
            use recursion to invoke collatz function until reaches 1 (to avoid recursive looping in function) w/num param w/sequence param ([first param]), second only used when recursive called (count steps)
            Callbacks<br>
            functions passed as args et invoked inside function passed to
        </p>
        <p>Event-Driven Async<br>
            callbacks great for async 
            JS single-threaded sed callback can be created/invoked when event happens
            called JS event loop
            callback semper waits for current execution stack to complete before invoked
            increase in use of async JS = more callbacks being used => spaghetti code, messy, confusing, lots of nested blocks
            (error 1st callback style popularized by Node.js: callbacks have two args, 1st error arg if something wrong, 2nd arg data returned by operation to be used in body of callback)
            promise: future result of async operation, help simplify process and avoid multiple callbacks
            Promise created -> calls async operation = pending
            remains pending while operation takes place, promise is 'unsettled'
            when complete, 'settled', then resolved (async success) or rejected (async didn't work right, wasn't completed, resulted in error) both return relevant data 
            create promise using constructor function: takes functin called executor as arg
            executor inits promise, starts async, accepts two functions as arg, resolve() (called if success), reject() (called if fail)
            const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {
                if (success) {
                    resolve(value);
                }
                else {
                    reject(error);
                }
            });
            once settled then() used to deal w/outcome 
            accept two args, 1st fulfillment function called when promise resolved, data returned from resolve() passed along to this function, 2nd arg rejection function receives data returned by reject()
            promise.then(result => success response)
            promise.catch(result => fail response)
            can be chained for more succinct descript 
            can chain multiple promises to form sequential piece of code, each promise beginning when prev promise settled
            async added ES2017, functions w/async keyword, write async code like sync
            use await operator before async
            wrap return val function val of funct in promise, can be assign to var, next code not executed until promise resolved
            wrap each step in try block, written in order of processing
            callbacks used to build more general function
            can write one function that accepts callback - abstraction (wrapping all logic away inside function)
            functions returning functions: to use returned, assign to var 
            use -> place parentheses post var to invoke function within
            make generic functions with specific info as param 
            closures - powerful JS feature 
            function scope destroys any vars when out of scope 
            to gain access to vars outside function when created et post function invoked: closure: ref to var created inside scope of another function, then kept alive and  kept alive in another part of program
            key principle: inner function declared inside another has full access to all vars in outer function
            outer only has access to its var, inner has access to all 
            returning functions: closure formed when inner funct returned by outer funct maintaining access to any vars in outer, assign var to return val of outer: const closure = outerFunction();
            closure now points to inner returned (as anon arrow funct) by outer 
            closure also no has access to both functions' inside vars 
            closure can also change val of var long after origin function invoked ex: counter funct returning funct that maintains and increments i var 
            Generators ES6 
            special functions to produce iterators that maintain state of val 
            to define: asterisk symbol (*) placed after function declaration: function * generatorFunct() {}
            calling generator doesn't run any of the function code, returns Generator obj to be used to create iterator implementing next() method returning val every time next() method called
            use yield keyword used to return val
            diff b/t yield and return = yield state of val returned remembered for next yield. 
            assign var to gnerator function w/ args to create generator obj stored in that var, inheriting method next(), used to obtain next val produced by yield commmand
            also can iterate over generator to invoke multiple times 
        </p>
        <p>Functional Programming<br>
            purely functional langs like Clojure, Scala, Erlang, Haskell (and much stricter to principles of functional programming)
            JS semper suppt'd this style b/c functions 1st class objs 
            functional programming paradigm like objected oriented or procedural 
            JS multi-paradigm lang 
            use of pure functions: function that adheres to rules: return val should only depend on vals provided as args (not vals from elsewhere in program), no side effects changing vals/data elsewhere in program, making non-destructive data transforms and returning new vals, instead of altering any underlying data, referential transparency, given same args, semper return same result 
            to follow these rules, need: at least one arg, return val
            pure functs make code more concise and predictable, easy to test, return vals can be cached, reduces bugs w/ surprise dependencies 
            ex: function reverse(string) {
                return string.split('').reverse().join('');
            }
            using const to declare vars helps avoid destructive data transforms
            use pure functions as building blocks of program, performing series of operatiosn w/o changing data state, each funct forms abstraction to perform single task, encaps details of implementation inside body, ita program becomes sequence of expressions based on the return val of pure functions, emphasis placed on using function composition to combine pure functions together to complete more complex tasks 
            pure functions more flexible, not tightly coupled
            make code more modular 
        </p>
        <p>Higher Order Functions<br>
            functs accepting another funct as arg or returning another funct as result or both 
            closures used for higher orders b/c create generic funct by creating closure round funct args to keep alive in return funct, use to build more specific functs w/diff args 
        </p>
        <p>Currying<br>
            process involving partial application of functs (named after Haskell Curry, logician)
            funct curried when not all args supplied to funct so returns another funct retaining provided args, expects omitted args when original funct called. only final result when all expected args provided 
            relies on higher-orders returning partially applied functs
            All curried functs are higher-orders sed not all higher-orders curried (square/rectangle situ)
            turns single funct into series of functs 
            useful if constantly calling funct w/same arg 
            can use curry funct to take any funct and allow partial application
            ex: function curry(func, ...oldArgs) {
                return function(...newArts) {
                    const allArgs = [...oldArgs,...newArgs];
                    return func(...allArgs);
                }
            }
            const divider = (x,y) => x/y;
            const reciprocal = curry(divider, 1); creates new function w/divider funct w/1st arg set 1
