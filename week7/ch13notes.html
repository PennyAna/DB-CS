        <p>
           Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows async communication w/server, dynamic update w/o reload 
            allows JS to request resources from server on behalf of client (usually JSON data or fragments of txt/HTMl)
            Need server-side lang (PHP, Ruby, Node.js or .NET) to serve data response post request 
            Same-Origin Policy: blocks all reqs from diff domain from page making req - enforced by all mod browsers to stop malicious JS being run from external source 
            sed APIs of many site rely on data transferred across domains
            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) solution allowing resources to be req'd from outside origin domain, works by using HTTP headers to control which domains can receive data 
            most mod browsers suppt and respect restrictions in the headers 
            (XML used at first, JSON more light and easier to parse, also natively suppt'd in JS so dealing w/JS objs not parsing XML w/DOM)
        </p>
        <p>
            unusual not to use Ajax when partial pg update needed 
            esp w/greater use of public APIs
            (API: application programming interface: collection of methods allows external access to other program/service, allows controlled access to site data, devs able to interact w/data/create mashups of 3rd party services, info returned often serialized as JSON, CORS enabled to access API info, some services also req authentication)
            XMLHttpRequest obj standardized by WHATWG et W3C w/HTML5 specs 
            superseded by Fetch API, living standard for req/send data async across network
            uses promises to avoid callback hell, streamlines concepts that had become cumbersome 
        </p>
        <p>
            Fetch API - global fetch() method w/single mandatory arg (url of resource fetching) 
            fetch('https://example.com/data')
            .then(//code handling response)
            .catch(//code if server returns error)<br>
            returns promise that resolves to response returned from URL provided as arg
            promise resolved when response received from url 
            b/c promise, use catch for any errors
            Response interface intro'd by Fetch API - deals w/obj returned when promise fulfilled
            <ul>response objs have props et methods to allow us to process response effectively
            <li>ok prop - checks if response success, based on HTTP status code (accessed using status prop), 200 if success, 201 if resource created, 204 if sucess sed no content returned, returns true if b/t 200-299
            need to manually check b/c promise only rejected in case of 404 (sed still considered success to promise)
            const url = 'https:example.com/data';
            fetch(url)
            .then((response) => {
                if(response.ok {
                    return response;
                }
                throw Error(response.statusText);
            })
            .then(response=> //do something w/response)
            .catch(error=> console.log('There was an error!'))
            error thrown refers to statusText prop of response obj, specifies status msg corresponding to code returned </li>
            <li>  headers - Headers obj containing any headers assoc. w/response </li>
            <li>url - string containing url of response </li>
            <li> redirected - bool specifying if response result of redirect </li>
           <li>
               <ul>
                type - string val of 
                <li>'basic' - response from same domain</li>
                <li>'cors' - data received from valid cross-origin req from diff domain </li>
                <li>'error' - network error occurs</li>
                <li>  'opaque' - response received from 'no-cors' req from another domain (access to data severely restricted) </li>
                </ul>
           </li>
           <li>
               redirect() - used to redirect to other url, creates new promise resolving response from redirected url 
               fetch(url)
               .then(response => response.redirect(newURL)); //redirects
               .then(//do something else)
               .catch(error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
               no current browser suppt for redirect()
           </li>
           <li>
               text() - takes stream of response text, reads to completion, returns promise that resolves to USVSting obj treated as string in JS 
               fetch(url)
               .then(response => response.text()); //transforms text stream into JS str
               .then(text => console.log(text))
               .catch(error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
               once promise resolved, use string() to return promise that resolves w/str rep of text returned 
           </li>
           <li>
               blob() - used to read file of raw data (image/spreadsheet), once whole file read, returns promise that resolves w/blob obj 
               fetch(url)
               .then(response => response.blog() );
               .then(blob => blob.type))
               .catch(error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
               use type prop to log MIME-type to log what type of file received
           </li>
           <li>
               JSON most common format
               json() method used to transform stream of JSON data into promise resolving to a JS obj 
               fetch(url) 
               .then(response => response.json());
               .then(data => console.log(Object.entries(data)))
               .catch(error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
               resolved as JS obj so can manip obj using JS
               Object.entries() used to view key/val pairs in returned obj 
           </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            can create own response obj using constructor function 
            const response = new Response('Hello!', {
                ok: true, status: 200, statusText: 'OK', type: 'cors', url: '/api'
            });
            1st arg is data to be returned, 2nd arg obj used to provide vals for any of props listed
            can be useful to use if creating API that needs to send a response or need to send a dummy response for testing 
        </p>
        <p>
            Request obj as arg gives more control over req, allows options to be set de req 
            create using Request() constructor w/props: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    url - url of requested resource, only prop req'd 
                </li>
                <li>
                    method - str specifying which HTTP method used for req, default GET 
                </li>
                <li>
                    headers - Headers obj gives details of req's headers 
                </li>
                <li>
                    mode - allows specify if CORS used or not, default yes 
                </li>
                <li>
                    cache - allows specify how req uses browser's cache (like force req/update cache or force look in cache)
                </li>
                <li>
                    credentials - specify if cookies allowed w/req 
                </li>
                <li>
                    redirect - specifies what to do if redirect response: 'follow', 'error', 'manual' (user clicks link to follow redirect)
                </li>
            </ul>
            constructor funct used to create new Request obj 
            const request = new Request('https://example.com/data', {
                method: 'GET', 
                mode: 'cors', 
                redirect: 'follow', 
                cache: 'no-cache'
            });
            url prop 1st arg (required), 2nd arg obj made up of props
            once Request obj assigned to var, can be used as param of fetch() method 
            fetch.request)
            .then(//do something w/response)
            .catch(//handle errors)
            OR
            fetch('https://example.com/data', {
                method: 'GET', 
                mode: 'cors', 
                redirect: 'follow', 
                cache: 'no-cache'
            })
            .then(//do something w/response)
            .catch(//handle errors)
        </p>
        <p>
            Headers used to pass add'tl info de request/response including file-type of resource, cookie info, authentication info, et when resource last mod'd 
            Fetch API intro'd Headers interface, use to create Headers obj which is added as prop of Request/Response objs
            create new w/constructor funct 
            const headers = new Headers();
            also opt arg containing init header vals
            const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })
            <ul>Obj includes:
                <li>has() - check of headers obj contains header provided as arg 
                    headers.has('Content-Type');
                </li> 
                <li>get() - returns val of arg header
                    headers.get('Content-Type');
                </li>
                <li>
                    set() - set val of already existing header or create new header w/arg val if does not already exist 
                    headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
                </li>
                <li>
                    append() - adds new header to headers obj 
                    headers.append('Accept-Encoding', 'gzip,deflate');
                </li>
                <li>delete() - removes arg header 
                    headers.delete('Accept-Encoding')
                </li>
                <li>keys(), values(), entries() - iterators to go over header k/v, entries (k/v pairs)
                    for(const entry of headers.entries() {
                        console.log(entry);
                    }  
                </li>
            </ul>
            use Headers, Request, Response obj to put together ex that sets up URL, Request, Headers before calling fetch()
            const url = 'https:example.com/data';
            const headers = new Headers({'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset': 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate'})
            const request = (url, {headers: headers})
            fetch(request)
            .then(function(response) {
                if(response.ok){
                    return response;
                }
                throw Error(response.statusText);
            })
            .then(response=> //do something w/response)
            .catch(error => console.log('There was an error!'))
        </p>
        <p>
            HTTP verbs/methods tell what type of req, then determines how server deals w/req 
            <ul>
                <li>GET - retrieve</li>
                <li>POST - request used to create resource or do task</li>
                <li>PUT requests to upsert (insert resource/update entirely)</li>
                <li>PATCH - requests partial update to resource</li>
                <li>DELETE - requests to dele resource</li>
            </ul>
            default: GET, forms also default GET sed often use POST request
        </p>
        <p>
            common to use spinners/egg timers to indicate site waiting
            Ajax Load/Preloaders.net good sources for creating spinner graphic 
        </p>
        <p>most forms have action attrib    specifying URL to use if form sent w/o Ajax, also method attrib to specify HTTP verb
            avail as props of form obj: 
            const request = new Request(form.action, {method: form.method, header: headers, body: data})
        </p>
        <p>Fetch API includes FormData interface, easier to submit form info using Ajax
            FormData instance: const data = new FormData();
            if form passed to this constructor funct as arg, form data instance serialize all data automatically, ready to be sent using Ajax 
            also add data to form data instance as k/v pairs using append() 
            data = new FormData(); //no form provided creates empty formdata instance
            data.append('height', 75);
            when form contains files to upload, used to require flash or plugin
            FormData instance auto create necesse settings and upload files if present in form 
        </p>
        <p>Living standard means specs dev'd in the wild 
            still subject to change through dev/vend/user feedback
            sed once implemented in browser engines, relatively stable 
            all browse sed IE support sed check level of suppt 1st 
            can also use library for Ajax requests - takes care of implement details behind scenes using most up-to-date methods if suppt'd and fallback on older methods if req'd 
            jQuery library good option - generic ajax method used like fetch() 
            $.ajax('http://numbserapi.com/random')
            .done(text=>outputDiv.innerHTML = text);
